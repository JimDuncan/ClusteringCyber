# ClusteringCyber

A graphical representation of an SSH Honey Pot

##Project Summary

This project is intended to graphically illustrate pertinent aspects of a cybersecurity dataset.  The dataset is an SSH Honey Pot that
logged over 4 million possible attacks over the course of a week in 2009.  The goal of this project is to identify useful and interesting
trends amongst the given data.  Additionally, this project will hopefully educate the reader on ways to cluster data that is in categorical
form.
